An example of OOD app for JupyterLab that uses ComputeCanada's CVMFS JH node component.
The idea is to illustrate that you can spawn the node component from OOD.

The code and templates comes from, or is influenced bym two MIT licensed repos:

https://github.com/ComputeCanada/puppet-magic_castle by Felix-Antoine Fortin at ULaval

https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter by OSC authors of OpenOnDemand.

On Nibi, 

* access Develop => MySandboxApps, 
* click for NewApp, and provide it with the URL of this repo.
* Use HTTPS rather than SSH.
* Enjoy the new app.
